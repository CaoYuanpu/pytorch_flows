# Normalizing flows with PyTorch

Implementation and tutorials of normalizing flows with the novel distributions module. The current set of tutorials and implementations is 
1. [Implementing and optimizing planar flows](flows_01.ipynb)
2. [Different types of invertible flows (radial, batchnorm, affine)](flows_02.ipynb)
3. [Using flows in variational inference (VAEs)](flows_03.ipynb)
4. [Auto-regressive types of flows (RealNVP, MAF, IAF)](flows_04.ipynb)
5. More advanced and recent type of flows
